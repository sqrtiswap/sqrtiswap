- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander
- ❗️ **2024-05-01:** I have moved most of my repos over to [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~xan) but for the purposes of collaborating/contributing I keep this account around.
- About that weird handle, it's just one of the entangling gates I spend my time on, e.g. for two qubits:
```math
\sqrt{\mathrm{iSWAP}} = \begin{pmatrix}
	1 & 0                  & 0                  & 0 \\
	0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & 0                  & 0                  & 1
\end{pmatrix}
```
