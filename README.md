- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alexander
- ðŸ‘€ Mostly the stuff here is utilities to make life easier on Unix-like systems. Most of the really interesting (scientific) code I'm not allowed to share here yet.
- About that weird handle, it's just one of the two-qubit entangling gates I spend my time on:
```math
\sqrt{\mathrm{iSWAP}} = \begin{pmatrix}
	1 & 0                  & 0                  & 0 \\
	0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & 0                  & 0                  & 1 \\
\end{pmatrix}
```
