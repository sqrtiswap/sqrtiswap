- 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander
- 👀 Mostly the stuff here is utilities to make life easier on Unix-like systems. Most of the really interesting (scientific) code I'm not able to share publically. If you have a good reason I can however give you read access individually.
- About that weird handle, it's just one of the entangling gates I spend my time on, e.g. for two qubits:
```math
\sqrt{\mathrm{iSWAP}} = \begin{pmatrix}
	1 & 0                  & 0                  & 0 \\
	0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & 0                  & 0                  & 1
\end{pmatrix}
```
